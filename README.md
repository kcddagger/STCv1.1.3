# STCv1.1.3
My Advanced Applications Development class project in Xamarin for Android 7.1 v1.1.3

I will be reworking this project from the bottom up in full Xamarin.Forms in the hopes that I'll have a fully compatible Sales Tax Calculator program for both IOS and Android I enjoyed the work I was able to get done for my project for class and want to continue working on the development to bring this out to a full development cycle so that I might be able to publish it on at least the Google Play Store.  I learned a lot about App development in the time I took to work on this and I have a long way to go before I can even consider myself competent.  In the next few weeks (Beginning of July 2018) look for STCv2.0 here on my GitHub if you wish to track my progress.

Thank you.
